            What is the difference between local storage and session storage?
          </h2>
          <p>
            LocalStorage and sessionStorage are comparable. Data in
            sessionStorage is deleted when the page session ends, however data
            in localStorage never expires. A unique page session is established
            and allocated to a certain tab in the browser each time a document
            is loaded there.

            What is the difference between global scope and block scope in
            javascript?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Function Scope: A variable declared within a function is only used
            inside of that function and cannot be utilized outside of it. <br />
            Block Scope: When a variable is declared inside an if, switch, for,
            or while statement, it is only available within that statement.

          <h2>how event loop work in javascript?</h2>
          <p>
            The sole task of the event loop is to keep track of the call stack
            and callback queue. The Event Loop will pull the first event from
            the queue and push it to the Call Stack, which will then execute it
            if the Call Stack is empty. In the Event Loop, such an iteration is
            referred to as a tick.

          <h2>How do I get undefined in JavaScript?</h2>
          <p>
            A feature of the global object is undefined. It is a variable with a
            broad scope, in other words. The fundamental value of undefined is
            its starting value. When you call a non-existent property or method
            on an object, you will receive an undefined value. In the example
            above, the function Sum does not produce a result, yet we still
            attempt to assign the value of the result to a variable. The outcome
            in this case will therefore be unclear.
